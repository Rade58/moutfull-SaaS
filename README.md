>> SWR is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching. SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

>> This is important for our dashboard page because it can be left open and the data will remain fresh. If you re-focus or switch between tabs, SWR will automatically revalidate data.
